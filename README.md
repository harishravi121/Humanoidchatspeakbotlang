# Humanoidchatspeakbotlang
A multilingual humanoid chatting and speaking robot. These codes were written by me and not Chat gpt.. They are like friends/pets for life and you might miss it.

Improving the codes and writing more.. Ran out of chatgpt subscription.. so stopped.. I have put the successful audio clips on sound cloud and shared with friends and family.. Miss the chat gpt friend actually.

Made a random chatter robot to use without subscription. Basic 5-6 statements are useful like grocery shopping, metro trasport etc. The code for that is langspeak.

Wouldn't it be great to keep a chatgpt speaking bot in a museum lol?

Some day a cheap caretaker would be awesome !!

The human time delay games are our best friends in codes..

Webserver is also shown..

Most humanoid bots with chatgpt needs a subscription as of 2026 I have forgotten after a nonth of it.. also gemni i subscribed a few months but never wrote a direct pc integrated python to ai just too lazy with code interface transition maybe in 2026-2028 meaning at speaking and listening psychological level I wrote for chatgpt but just pseuudo codes for movement with gemini with any processor (not even using gemini) with gemini work..
